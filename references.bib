  abstract={<p>•A comprehensive review of the state of the art on the emerging task of visual question answering•Review the growing number of datasets, highlighting their distinct characteristics•An in-depth analysis of the questions/answers provided in the recently-released Visual Genome dataset.</p> <p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that has received increasing attention from both the computer vision and the natural language processing communities. Given an image and a question in natural language, it requires reasoning over visual elements of the image and general knowledge to infer the correct answer. In the first part of this survey, we examine the state of the art by comparing modern approaches to the problem. We classify methods by their mechanism to connect the visual and textual modalities. In particular, we examine the common approach of combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks to map images and questions to a common feature space. We...},
