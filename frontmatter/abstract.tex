Contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong visual question answering baseline on gold-standard scene graphs to aid evaluation of future scene graph generation methods
    \item Representation of relationships as nodes to enable the use of node-based graph convolutions, with a guarante worst-case time complexity.
    \item Outperform human baseline, outperform ensemble methods by 14\% and over 26\% above single-model methods. Although this is on a split of the GQA validation set, it shows the promise of VQA on graph structures.
\end{itemize}
