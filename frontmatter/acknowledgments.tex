To my supervisors, Dr. Caren Han and Dr. Josiah Poon,

Thank you for the opportunity to work alongside you in the University of Sydney NLP research group. To Caren, I thank you for always making yourself available to answer my questions, review my writing and motivating me to keep developing new ideas. To Josiah, thank you for all your efforts in organising weekly research group meetings and providing wonderful opportunities to collaborate with other researchers despite the challenges of moving online this year.

To my parents,

Thank you for your endless support over the past four years, for providing me with the opportunity to study full-time and for helping me to keep pushing forward though the many challenges I faced this year. Thank you for being the best parents I could ever ask for.

To my girlfriend, Ayuka,

Thank you for standing by my side through the good and the bad, supporting me regardless of how my research was progressing throughout the year. Thank you for being the highlight of my day each and every day this year. I could not ask for a better friend and I am inexpressibly grateful to have you as a part of my life.
