\section{Architecture Overview}
\label{section:architecture_overview}

In this section, I propose a new model for single-concept open-ended visual question answering tasks. The proposed model comprises six main components, as shown in \figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:model_overview}} and outlined briefly below:

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{model_overview.png}
    \caption{A high-level overview of the proposed visual-question-answering model.}
    \label{fig:model_overview}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Question embedding:} In classic NLP fashion, the question embedding component is responsible for the preprocessing and vectorisation of raw question data for use by the rest of the model.

\textbf{Question module:} The question module has two main roles: the first is to learn a sequence of contextual words {\color{red}(TODO: Insert nomenclature)} that capture the relevant features of each question word in the context of the question as a whole. Secondly, the question module learns a question-level embedding that contains information about the question as a whole.

\textbf{Scene graph embedding:} The scene graph embedding model is responsible for the preprocessing and vectorisation of scene graph data. In this dissertation, I use ground-truth scene graphs from the GQA dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of various scene graph modules under perfect-sight conditions. This component can be readily extended to utilise the output of existing scene graph generation models \cite{yang2018graph, li2019relation}, yielding a true end-to-end VQA model.

\textbf{Scene graph module:} The primary goal of the scene graph module is to learn a dense representation of scene graph features that can be used as a knowledge-base for the reasoning module to draw information from when answering questions.

\textbf{Reasoning module:} Given the output features of the scene graph and question modules, the reasoning module is in charge of determining which visual features are relevant to the question and vice-versa. The reasoning capabilities of many existing VQA models could be leveraged here; I justify my reasoning module of choice and describe its implementation in detail in \sectionautorefname{ \ref{section:reasoning_module}}.

\textbf{Output module:} The output module is the simplest part of the architecture, and is responsible for transforming the output of the reasoning module into a concrete answer to the input question. I delve into the design decisions behind the output module and how it might be modified for other VQA tasks in \sectionautorefname{ \ref{section:output_module}}.

\section{Question Embedding}
\label{section:question_embedding}

The question embedding component of the architecture is responsible for two major tasks: preprocessing and vectorisation. The preprocessing step is performed prior to the training of the model, where vectorisation of preprocessed question words occurs at runtime. 

I use a neural preprocessing pipeline for each raw question string in the dataset, comprising tokenisation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, lemmatisation and dependency parsing steps.\footnote{For this architecture, only the tokenisation step is required since the question module uses word embeddings but not syntactic dependency information. Graph-based question modules use syntactic dependencies for graph construction, as described in \sectionautorefname{ \ref{sec:ablation_studies}}.} For reproducibility, I use the Stanza NLP package \cite{qi2020stanza} for all steps of the pipeline.

After tokenisation, each question \(q\) is represented as a sequence of tokens \((t_1, ..., t_{l_q})\), where \(l_q\) is the number of tokens in the question. For each question \(q\), each  token \(t\) is converted to an index to enable vector embedding lookups during training. A mapping of all question tokens to their respective indices is kept, with indices being shared between the training and validation sets. Reference answers are converted to indices in a similar fashion, however they are not tokenised first: multi-word answers like \textit{parking meter} or \textit{cutting board} are treated as a single concept, identically to single-word answers like \textit{bed}. This ensures  multi-word answers can be predicted just as easily as single-word answers and allows the output module to treat the question-answering task as a multi-class classification problem across the set of all candidate answers.

At runtime, each question token is converted to a \(d_q = 300\) dimensional GloVe vector \cite{pennington2014glove}, then token embeddings for a given question are stacked together, yielding a matrix of question features \(H_q \in \R^{l_q \times d_q}\) where \(l_q\) is the number of tokens in the question. For a batch of questions \(Q_{[i:i+k]}\) the corresponding features \(\{H_{q_i}, ..., H_{q_{i+k}}\}\) are padded with zeros along the first dimension and then stacked to yield a batch of question features \(H_{Q_{[i:i+k]}} \in \R^{k \times l \times d_q}\), where \(l = \max_{i \leq j < i+k} l_{q_j}\), the number of tokens in the longest question in the batch. \(H_{Q_{[i:i+k]}}\) is the output of the question embedding module and the input to the question module.

\section{Scene Graph Embedding}
\label{section:scene_graph_embedding}

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{section:scene_graph_embedding_motivation}

The primary goal of the scene graph embedding process is to build a directed graph \(\mathcal{G}_r = (\mathcal{V}_r, \mathcal{E}_r)\) and an associated node feature matrix \(H_r \in \R^{|\mathcal{V}| \times d_r}\) from a visual representation \(r\). These node features are essential information for the scene graph module, which utilises node-based graph convolutions to capture dependencies and relationships between nodes in the graph. In this dissertation, I intentionally use gold-standard scene graphs as a visual input to evaluate the effectiveness of different scene graph modules, as discussed in \sectionautorefname{ \ref{sec:ablation_studies}}. Since my primary focus is on scene graphs as a visual input signal, I will consider all general visual representations \(r\) to be scene graphs for the remainder of this section.

Both the GQA and CLEVR datasets contain ground-truth scene graph information for each image in the training and validation sets. Although different datasets store scene graph information differently, the three basic components of a scene graph are objects, relationships and attributes. For example, the CLEVR dataset contains three object types (cube, sphere, cylinder), twelve attribute types covering size (small, large), material (metal, rubber) and colour (red, green, blue, yellow, purple, cyan, brown, grey), and four spatial relationships (left, right, in front, behind). The GQA dataset is more complex, containing, a total of 1703 unique objects, 310 unique relations, and 617 unique attributes across the combined train and validation sets. Adopting common notation from \cite{hudson2019gqa, li2019relation, yang2018graph}, each directed relationship between two objects in a scene graph can be described as a triplet \texttt{<subject, relation, object>}, \textit{e.g.} \texttt{<parrot, behind, fence>}\footnote{Although the \texttt{subject} and \texttt{object} are both represented by objects in a scene graph, this notation disambiguates the direction of the relationship by drawing upon well-defined grammatical terms, \textit{e.g.} the triple \texttt{<parrot, behind, fence>} is readliy converted to the clause: \textit{The parrot is behind the fence}.}. For scene graphs containing attributes, we can use a pair \texttt{<object, attribute>} to denote attribute associations, \textit{e.g.} \texttt{<parrot, white>}. More formally, we can represent a raw scene graph 
\(r\) like so:

\begin{align*}
    r &= (r_o, r_r, r_a, r_{(s,r,o)}, r_{(o, a)})\\
    r_o & = \text{The set of all unique objects in \(r\)}\\
    r_r & = \text{The set of all unique relations in \(r\)}\\
    r_a & = \text{The set of all unique attributes in \(r\)}\\
    r_{(s,r,o)} \subseteq r_o \times r_r \times r_o & = \text{The set of (subject, relation, object) triples in \(r\)}\\
    r_{(o, a)} \subseteq r_o \times r_a & = \text{The set of (object, attribute) pairs in \(r\)}\\
\end{align*}

There are multiple points to consider when converting a general scene graph representation \(r\) to its directed graph \(\mathcal{G}_r\) and associated node features \(H_r\); my scene graph embedding choice has two main motivations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The scene graph embedding needs to provide adequate information to answer a variety of questions, regardless of whether they ask about an object \textit{e.g. What type of bird is that?}, an attribute \textit{e.g. What colour is the bird?} or a relationship between two objects \textit{e.g. Is the bird behind the fence?}.
    \item The goal of the scene graph module is to update the initial object, attribute and relation embeddings created by the scene graph embedding stage to include dependency information. These dependencies are readily captured by existing node-based graph convolutional layers like GCN and GAT layers, however, to utilise these methods, all features that may be relevant to question answering must be represented as node features.
\end{enumerate}

The first point insinuates that objects, attributes and relations should be embedded similarly in the scene graph to aid the reasoning module in its decisions; if we embedded objects differently to relations in the scene graph, then the reasoning module has to learn to respond differently to questions that ask about objects versus those that ask about relationships between objects. Conversely, by embedding relationships, attributes and objects in a similar manner, I hypothesise that the reasoning module is more likely to transfer reasoning skills between similarly-posed but differently-targeted questions.

The second motivation poses an issue: assume we have \(n_o\) objects and \(n_r\) relations for any particular scene graph. Assuming all \(n_o\) objects are represented as nodes in the graph, then embedding every relationship between two objects as a node instead of an edge increases the upper bound of nodes in the graph from \(O(n_o)\) to \(O(n_o + n_r) = O(n_o^2)\) nodes, increasing the computational complexity of any parts of the model that operate on the graph's nodes. Conversely, omitting relational data from node embeddings may hinder the model's ability to answer questions requiring logical reasoning about relationships between objects. I explore this trade-off between computational complexity and performance in \sectionautorefname{ \ref{sec:ablation_studies}}.

\subsection{Technical details}
\label{section:scene_graph_embedding_details}

The preprocessing of objects, relations and attributes is similar to the way answers were processed in the question embedding embedding step: all objects, relations and attributes are converted to indices, keeping a separate map of tokens to indices for each. This ensures that words which may be used as an object or an attribute \textit{e.g. glass} are distinguished based on context. This allows the scene graph module to learn different embeddings for the same word based on the contexts in which they occur in a scene graph.

At runtime, each object, relation and attribute index is associated with a \(d_r = 300\) dimensional GloVe vector, then all vectors are stacked together to produce an embedding matrix of scene graph node features \(H_S\) spanning the object, relation and attribute vocabulary of the combined train and validation datasets \(S\), \textit{i.e.} \(H_S \in \R^{(|S_o| + |S_r| + |S_a|) \times d_r}\) where \(S_o = \bigcup_{r \in R} r_o\) is the set of unique scene graph objects in \(S\), \(S_r = \bigcup_{r \in R} r_r\) is the set of unique scene graph relations in \(S\) and \(S_a = \bigcup_{r \in R} r_a\) is the set of unique scene graph  attributes in \(S\). 

These global node features \(H_S\) are shared by all scene graphs, and fine-tuned via backpropagation  during training.
{\color{red} TODO: Explain better}
For each scene graph \(v\), relevant node embeddings for objects, relations and attributes are selected from \(H_S\) according to the node indices determined in the preprocessing step. This yields a matrix of node embeddings for that scene graph, \(H_v\)


y, \(\mathcal{G}_v\) and \(H_v\) are created according to \algorithmcfname{ \ref{algorithm:scene_graph_construction}}:

As illustrated in \figureautorefname{ \ref{fig:model_overview}}, and described in \algorithmcfname{ \ref{algorithm:scene_graph_construction}},  \(\mathcal{V}_V\) contains a node for every object, relation and attribute in the scene graph. Nonetheless, constructing the scene graph in this manner allows the direct application of sparse node-based graph convolutional layers in the scene graph module.

Given the goal of the question module is to learn a dense contextual and syntactic representation of the question, and the goal of the scene graph module is to capture dependency information between objects, attributes and relations in the scene, we still need to combine and reason about this extracted information. All VQA models have to handle this multi-modal fusion and reasoning in some capacity, with adopting taking fusion-only approaches, whilst others learn self-attention or bidirectional attention weights between question and image modalities, and others leverage the strengths of both methods. For my model, I leverage the reasoning capabilities of the Compositional Attention Network \citeauthor{hudson2018compositional}, a recurrent model that decomposes complex question-answering problems into discrete reasoning steps, each of which is performed by a single cell in the network. The Compositional Attention Network achieved state-of-the-art results on the CLEVR dataset in \citeyear{hudson2018compositional}, achieving 

In order to leverage the computational benefits of sparse tensor operations implemented in PyG \cite{fey2019fast}, I used a PyTorch \cite{paszke2019pytorch} re-implementation of the MAC network, which has been trained to 98.6\% on the CLEVR dataset \cite{eyzaguirre2020differentiable}, just 0.3\% shy of the official result reported by 
\citeauthor{hudson2018compositional}. Notably, this re-implementation accounts for minor details that were omitted from the original MAC network paper but enabled by default in the official MAC network repository {\color{red} citation required}.
